# The royal.yaml file exists at the root of every agent project.
# It's used to set up the builder (and if applicable, translation) services.
# The following file is simply an example of how a royal.yaml config file looks like.

name: example-agent
version: 1.0

# The translator is used to translate messages between the C2 and agent.
translator_name: example_tr
translator_type: native

# The command schema defines the possible commands that can be used with the agent.
# If the agent doesn't use commands to operate, then this configuration parameter is not necessary.
# On installation of the agent, the command schema is used by the translator when an operator requests to
# view commands.
cmd_schema:
  - name: ls
    usage: ls [path]
    n_args: 1
    admin: false
    # If opcode is specified, the provided integer opcode is used in place of the command name, promoting better OpSec
    opcode: 0x1
    description_short: list files in a directory.
